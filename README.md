# Kotlin Ktor Api Example

I will try to build an example of using **[Ktor](https://ktor.io/)** powered by **[Gradle](https://gradle.org/)** to for building an Api and a SPA (I didn't decide the laguage yet). Of course talking about Ktor the progamming languaje will be **[Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)** by Jetbrains using **IntelliJ** and **VSCode** mostly.

Some tasks:  
1. Add a docker file and contenize the app, and automatize the build, with watch compiling.
2. Simple Api operations CRUD with a simple domain.
3. Make a SPA for the API, maybe with Redux.
4. Complete README.

On process ...
